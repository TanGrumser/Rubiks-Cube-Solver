[x] Reverse lexicographic rank function
    [x] Write test, that applies 100 random moves calculate state index, reverse state from index and compares them
    [x] Write function
    
[x] Table Generation Meta Data to saved to file
[x] Table generation uses inverse lexicographic rank function at depth > 10
[x] Start New Table generation
[x] Write solving results to file to collect better structured benchmark data
[x] Write e group inverse state geeration method.
[ ] Test it
[ ] After lookup table generation is finished run performance test on 100 random scrambles
[ ] Benchmark two Duplicate state detection methods
[ ] check edge lookup table
